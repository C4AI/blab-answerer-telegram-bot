base/Noronha_hotspot.txt 11
Paragraph about Noronha hotspot
=> One problem with the hotspot theory is that the geochronology of the Fernando de Noronha and mainland Brazil volcanics are not necessarily consistent with a mantle plume, much of the volcanic activity in both regions was contemporaneous for example. Further, seismic tomography has not imaged a mantle plume, although isolated seismic anomalies may reflect the existence of the hotspot. There are also geochemical problems. Several alternate theories have been proposed:

=> Ecosystem models have been developed for the Abrolhos Bank (northeast), southeastern Brazilian Bight (southeast) and southern Brazil shelf ecosystem. These models are basically used as research tools and at this time have not been used as tools for supporting decision-making in fisheries management. Bio-economic models have been applied to industrial sardine and trawling fisheries in the southeastern Brazilian Bight and probably to other large stocks and fisheries (e.g. shrimps and lobsters). In general terms, it is not a common practice in fisheries management in Brazil to take into account uncertainties or to conduct any form of formal risk assessment when making decisions regarding fisheries regulation. Contents of regulations are the result of a number of influences, economic, political and scientific, but very often, and particularly with the phasing-out of GPEs, these influences are not transparent.

It sits on the eastern coast of Brazil, surrounding part of Bahia's capital Salvador and opening to the Atlantic Ocean. It covers 1,223 square kilometers (472 sq mi), making it the largest bay in Brazil.

base/coastal_fisheries_of_brazil_7.txt 14
Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 7
=> In addition to these impacts on artisanal fisheries, there has been a dramatic increase in the demand for fish in the growing urban centres. Some valuable fish species, such as shrimp and lobsters, are more intensively exploited. When profitability decreased, most industrial fishing crews started exploiting fish resources with no respect for existing traditional regulations. In some cases, artisanal fishers started using the same forbidden fishing gear in order to survive.Third, traditional sea tenure is threatened as well by erroneous environmental and aquaculture plans that should benefit artisanal fishers in principle. Government institutions are encouraging aquaculture; however, traditional extensive aquaculture systems already used by artisanal fishers are very often not considered. As a result, in some cases capital owners and outsiders are the only ones who benefit from these initiatives. The government also promoted the cultivation of species already managed by artisanal fishers. The adoption of these techniques does not necessarily lead to an improvement in the well-being of local communities. For instance, the government planned to introduce mullet cultivation through floating nets (cercos flutuantes) instead of supporting the existing technique of the traditional cerco made of bamboo poles. In fact, floating nets are more capital intensive, less labour intensive and would disrupt the existing social organization. In the end, the new technique was eventually rejected by artisanal fishers.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 4
=> Oil exploration and production is an important economic activity along the Brazilian coast, which started in 1973. The main oil drilling areas along the coast are in Campos (Rio de Janeiro), Sergipe, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Amazon basin and Recôncavo Baiano. Over 56% of the oil produced in Brazil comes from marine basins. There are important harbours where oil is brought ashore, the most important of which is situated in São Sebastião (São Paulo), where tourism, fisheries, mangroves and other coastal habitats suffer from frequent oil spills in the area. Coal is also produced in the coastal area of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Reefs are also exploited for construction, mainly along the northeastern coast.

base/Alcatrazes_Islands.txt 8
Paragraph about Alcatrazes Islands
=> Alcatrazes possesses rich fauna and flora; by December 2019, 1,3 thousand species had been registered there, 93 of which were deemed endangered and 20 were endemic, including the Bothrops alcatraz, the Scinax alcatraz and the true frog Cycloramphus faustoi. Other endemic species yet to be discovered are believed to exist there, including a species of coral snake which two only known individuals were lost during the fire at the Instituto Butantan.Such occurrence of endemism lead the archipelago to be nicknamed "the Galápagos of Brazil" by some researchers, who believe Charles Darwin would have come to the same conclusions he came to in the Equatorian archipelago had he studied the fauna of Alcatrazes. As described in the sub-section "Geology" above, the islands were for tens of thousands of years linked to the continent, which provided easy access to the place for several species. As the waters rose again and the mountains returned to their island status, the animals that were stranded there either died or adapted and evolved, giving birth to all those unique species.On the main island there is the world's biggest cluster of frigatebirds' nests, with a gathering of 6,000 individuals. Some 10,000 birds live in the archipelago, with over 100 different confirmed species, including endangered ones like the American oystercatcher and the South American tern.In the waters surrounding the archipelago, several species live among the grooved brain corals, including 400 species of invertebrates and between 200 and 250 species of fish, a number superior to anywhere else in Brazil, including the much bigger Fernando de Noronha archipelago, with 150 species. The place is also visited by cetaceans. The not so long but also not so short distance between island and continent combined with the fact that it is located in a transition zone of warm tropical waters to colder subtropical ones make for the big diversity of fishes.The sea around the islands wouldn't receive much attention until the 1990s, because diving was not yet regarded as a true scientific tool in Brazil. It was in the archipelago that such reality began to change.Beside the Navy exercises, another threat to the local ecosystem is the sea pollution, be it from chemical dejects (which contaminate the plankton and, consequently, the whole food chain involved with it) or incorrectly disposed waste. The invasive orange cup coral is another risk to the local fauna. They were first detected in 2011 and, since then, they are monitored and removed so they do not become a plague, although its eradication is no longer considered possible to achieve.

Also, the state features the Campos Basin, the largest petroleum rich area in Brazil, measuring 100,000 km² and producing 1.49 million barrels of oil every day. The basin extends to the coastline of Espírito Santo. 1,200 km east of Vitória, in Espírito Santo, lie the islands of Trindade and Martim Vaz.

base/coastal_fisheries_of_brazil_3.txt 13
Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 3
=> The infrastructure for landing, storage and commercialization of fish is very precarious. In general, the large ports have no infrastructure to accommodate landings from artisanal fisheries. In many fishing communities, especially in the northeast, fish is landed on the beach and from there it enters a long chain of dealers until it gets to local/regional markets. The situation seems to be even worse in fishing communities close to urban centres, because they lack adequate structures to land and process fish in urban conditions. Past experiences in the northeast in the construction of fisheries production facilities for landing and cold-storage associated with cooperatives (funded during the 1980s by the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB]) did not work satisfactorily. The vast majority of these facilities ended up in the hands of middlemen. At the same time, many cooperatives failed because they were formed in a rush, without the proper evaluation of the administrative capacity of fishing communities and of market demands. More recent experiences in the northeast with the ‘Pro-Renda’ (a governmental programme that aims to increase the income level of poorer communities) seem to be more successful than the previous experiences with cooperatives. The programme is based on strengthening the existing fishers’ guilds, improving techniques to maintain the quality of fish on board using freezers, and developing new markets for artisanal fisheries production. Fish marketing, improvement of the quality of fisheries products, and the processes of intermediation within the market chain continue to be the critical points for the development of artisanal fisheries and increasing the income levels of artisanal fishers.

base/coastal_fisheries_of_brazil_1.txt 11
Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 1
=> Artisanal fisheries in the northeast are based on small- to medium-sized boats (most of them <12 m long) using sail or small engines, canoes using oars or sail, and sail rafts. There is a large diversity of species and fishing gear/methods used in coastal fisheries in the northeast. Lessa et al. (2004) identified, for instance, at least 16 types of gear used by small-scale fishers in Pernambuco, one of the states of the northeast region. In general, gillnets, longlines and hook-and-line are used in coastal and offshore waters to catch snappers, groupers, mackerel, sardines, pompanos, tunas and dolphinfish. Lobsters are captured mostly with gillnets (caçoeiras) and by diving. Shrimp trawling is conducted in certain areas close to the mouth of estuaries. Gillnets, trammel nets, cast nets, manual trawling and traps are employed closer to shore and inside estuaries and coastal lagoons to capture anchovies, mullets, needle-fish, and shrimps, among other species. The manual collection of crabs and molluscs in mangrove areas is particularly important throughout the region.

The Paraguaçu River travels 500 kilometers (310 mi) to empty into the bay and the coastal lowlands of the Reconcavo Basin are at its mouth. It contains 91 islands, the largest being Itaparica Island at its entrance. Other important islands include the Ilha dos Frades, ilha de Maré, ilha de Bom Jesus, and the small Ilha do Medo.

base/Ilha_dos_Frades.txt 12
Paragraph about Ilha dos Frades

base/Rio_Grande_Rise.txt 4
Paragraph about Rio Grande Rise
=> A Brazilian-Japanese expedition in 2013 recovered in situ granitic and metamorphic rocks on the Rio Grande Rise. This can possibly indicate that the plateau includes fragments of continental crust — possible remains of micro-continents similar to those found on and around Kerguelen in the Indian Ocean and Jan Mayen in the Arctic Ocean. The existence of such microcontinents is speculative, however, since their remains tend to be covered by younger layers of lava and sediments. Nevertheless, transoceanic dispersals are hinted at by the fossil record of, for example, flightless birds such as Lavocatavis, indicating that several islands between Africa and South America made island hopping possible across the Atlantic during the Tertiary (66 to 2.58 Ma).At the beginning of the Maastrichtian, the characteristics of water masses differed north and south of the Rio Grande Rice-Walvis Ridge complex. The disappearance of these differences during the Maastritchtian indicates a reorganisation of oceanic circulation patterns that lead to a global homogenisation of intermediate and deep waters. This process seems to have been triggered by the breaching of the Rio Grande Rise-Walvis Ridge complex and the disappearance of epicontinental seaways such as the Tethys Ocean. The process resulted in the deterioration of rudist-dominated tropical habitats and consequently the extinction of benthic inoceramid bivalves.The origin of modern circulation of cold, deep water — known as the "Big Flush" — is associated with Early Eocene (55 to 40 Ma) geological events; tectonism that resulted in the opening of the north-east Atlantic and fracture zones that developed in the subsiding Rio Grande Rise, which allowed cold water from the Antarctic Weddell Sea to flow northward into the North Atlantic. 40 Ma, the generation of cold bottom water in the Antarctic resulted in the formation of psychrospheric fauna, which today live in temperatures below 10 °C (50 °F), in the Atlantic and Tethys. This global distribution suggests that the Rio Grande Rise had been breached by this time, allowing cold, dense water to move north-south through a corridor enhancing the transition from a latitudinal thermospheric circulation to a meridional thermohaline circulation.

base/coastal_fisheries_of_brazil_1.txt 11
Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 1
=> Coastal fisheries have been receiving an increasing level of attention from governmental and academic institutions in Brazil in recent years. The reasons for this are many, but the most important are: the general failure of governmental policies for the development of the fisheries sector, which have been focused almost exclusively on industrial fisheries; the growing recognition of the importance of artisanal fishers who, without support from the government, continue to supply local and regional markets; the innumerable pressures that artisanal fishing communities have been suffering, owing to the expansion of the interests of the real-estate and tourism sectors and environmental degradation – factors that often force the fishers to move to cities, having lost their land; the coverage given to these conflicts by the press; the recent political liberalization in Brazil after the military regime (1964 to 1984), which allowed the marginalized and forgotten groups of society to express themselves more freely, especially in defence of their rights and aspirations in the Constituent National Assembly; the work carried out by non-governmental organizations, in particular, the Catholic Church, through the activities of the Fisheries’ Pastoral mainly in the north and northeastern states; and the birth of the National Movement of Fishers (MONAPE) in 1989.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 1
=> In this study coastal artisanal fishers are defined as independent fish harvesters whose livelihood is based on fishing, on a part or full-time basis, using labour and knowledge-intensive fishing techniques, and employing family or community labour, often on a sharing basis, for harvesting in coastal habitats. The fish caught are normally sold in the local market, usually through middlemen, although some is for home consumption. The artisanal fisheries sector has a longstanding tradition in Brazil. Before the governmental incentives to develop industrial fisheries in 1967, artisanal fisheries accounted for more than 80% of the fish production in the country. Today it is responsible for approximately 54% of the total marine landings of about 516 000 tonnes (Figure 2).

In the south region, between Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, live the descendants of the Azoreans and Portuguese that settled in the region in the seventeenth century. The first European generations were both peasants and fishers, but since the late 1940s they have concentrated mainly on fishing. The caiçaras, who live between Paraná and the state of Rio de Janeiro, are descendants of the Indians, Portuguese colonizers and African slaves. They practice small-scale agriculture associated with artisanal fishing. The jangadeiros (raft-fishers) live in the northeast coast, from Bahia to Fortaleza, and they depend almost exclusively on artisanal fishing, using the jangada (a raft with sails) that is very suitable for the type of sea, wind and sandy coast of the area.

base/Rio_Grande_Rise.txt 4
Paragraph about Rio Grande Rise
=> The Rio Grande Rise separates the Santos and Pelotas Basins and is composed of western and eastern areas, which have different geological backgrounds. The western area has numerous guyots and seamounts and a basement dated to 80 to 87 million years ago. The eastern area is covered by fracture zones and may represent an abandoned spreading centre. In the western area, volcanic breccia and layers of ash indicate widespread volcanism during the Eocene, which coincides with the formation of volcanic rocks onshore. During this period, parts of the western plateau were uplifted over sea level and short-lived volcanic islands formed.When West Gondwana (i.e. South America) broke away from Africa during the Early Cretaceous (146 to 100 Ma), the South Atlantic opened up from its southern to its northern end. In this process, the voluminous Paraná and Etendeka continental flood basalts formed in what is now Brazil and Namibia. This event is linked to the Tristan-Gough hotspot, now located near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, close to Tristan da Cunha and the Gough Islands. During the Maastrichtian (60 Ma), the orientation of spreading changed, which is still visible on the African side, and volcanism ended on the American side. This process resulted in the Tristan-Gough seamount chains on either side of the Tristan-Gough hotspot.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 5
=> According to the analysis of fisheries development stages, the percentage of collapsed stocks increases from north to south, being 3% in the north, 12% in the northeast, 29% in the southeast, and 32% in the south. The available information indicates that small-scale fisheries seem to be less limited by resource scarcity in the north and northeast, where landings have been increasing in recent years (Vasconcellos et al., 2007) and a larger proportion of stocks are either in a stage of development, mature, or recovering from previous overfishing. Nonetheless, the real situation of the stocks in the north and northeast is more uncertain, particularly in the northeast, because of the lower quality of fisheries statistics and the overall predominance of small-scale fisheries in these regions. On the other hand, the southeast and south regions have been experiencing a marked decline in landings and present a higher percentage of fisheries in a senescent or collapsed stage. Consequently, there are no prospects of increasing production in these regions except through the application of more restrictive fishing measures (for both artisanal and industrial fisheries that share the resources), or through the development of fisheries directed to resources not yet commercially exploited, such as the anchovy.

base/Recife_Port.txt 6
Paragraph about Recife Port
=> Historically, the port has been the main reason of the foundation of the village of Recife back in the 16th century. The history of the port is deeply linked to the economic rise, social-economic and cultural development of the city, the state and the Northeast region of Brazil; for being the main point of trade in goods and supplies to another states. In the 16th century, the increasing movement of import, production and export of sugar, emerged along the vicinity of the port bringing the pioneer European settlers to live exclusively from commerce.

Paragraph about Exclusive economic zone of Brazil
=> The Blue Amazon (Portuguese: A Amazônia Azul) or Brazilian maritime territory (Portuguese: território marítimo brasileiro) is the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Brazil. It is an offshore area of 3.6 million square km on the Brazilian coast, rich in marine biodiversity and energy resources. The size is equivalent to the surface of the Amazon rainforest. The name is a reference to the biologically rich region of the Brazilian Amazon, with the addition of the adjective blue denoting the ocean.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 3
=> The role of women in fishing activities has decreased in some cases due to technological changes and overexploitation of coastal resources. Women who take an active part in fishing still maintain their traditional status – their activities are viewed as ‘support’ in running the household. The majority of the fishers’ guilds maintain the traditional gender division of labour. The ‘double-workday’ of women continues to be thought of as ‘part-time activity’. A woman involved in the administration of the colônias is still considered a little ‘out of place’.

base/coastal_fisheries_of_brazil_5.txt 13
Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 5
=> The management of fisheries in Brazil is mainly the responsibility of the federal government, which is responsible for assessing the status of the stocks and for setting and enforcing regulations on the use of aquatic living resources. Governmental institutional arrangements for regulating fisheries activities have been changing over the years. The role of the federal government in marine fisheries management became particularly influential in the mid-1960s with the creation of SUDEPE, an agency of the Ministry of Agriculture with sole responsibility for the development and management of fisheries. Later in 1989, fisheries became one of the agendas of IBAMA (Brazilian Institute of the Environment), a subsidiary of the Ministry of Environment. The shift of management responsibilities from SUDEPE to IBAMA was not favourable to artisanal fisheries. As IBAMA focuses its attention mostly on environmental issues, environmental legislation and law enforcement, there has been little attention given to the sustained development of artisanal fishing communities. In 1998, the government shifted a large part of the responsibilities of the fisheries sector from IBAMA to the Ministry of Agriculture, constituting the Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (DPA). The main responsibility of DPA was to promote and execute programmes and projects to support the development of the industrial fisheries (its main objective was to promote the development of the sector and to manage unexploited fisheries resources). On the other hand, IBAMA was responsible for executing the national policies for the environment, and particularly for managing endangered and overexploited species, and encouraging the sharing and decentralization of decisions through co-management and community-based management initiatives. The development policies put forth by these two agencies were not only diverse but opposite and conflictive in their approach to resource management. According to Dias-Neto (1999) such a change represented “one of the most anarchical moments in fisheries management in Brazilian history”. Dias-Neto and Marrul-Filho (2003) highlighted the three main institutional conflicts created with the division of responsibilities between IBAMA and DPA. The first one was of a legal nature, related to the division of competencies in fisheries management, and in the organization and maintenance of the national system of control and licensing of fishing activities. The second one was conceptual, since stocks are intrinsically linked in the marine environment through ecological and/or technological interactions, and in multispecific fisheries the same fishing activity often targets stocks with different exploitation levels. Besides, a stock that is considered unexploited at a given moment could eventually be overfished and, hence, the same species could be under the responsibility of two different agencies at different moments in time. As stated by the authors “IBAMA and DPA were trying to divide the indivisible”. The third conflict was related to the transfer of responsibility from IBAMA to DPA for the management and control of foreign fleets fishing under joint-venture arrangement, and the consequent changes in the rules and norms.

base/coastal_fisheries_of_brazil_7.txt 14
Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 7
=> Environmentally protected areas in regions traditionally used by artisanal fishers are often perceived by them as threats. The well-conserved areas of the Atlantic Forest and associated coastal system have been used by traditional communities for centuries. Due to their isolation, as well as to the existing social structure of these communities, those areas have remained well conserved. However, due to existing legislation, traditional populations cannot live in the regions that became protected and have to be transferred to other areas. Highly conflictive situations are being created in almost all protected areas and local communities resist eviction from their traditional land. This is the case in the Ecological Station of Juréia, the Biological Reserve of Guaraqueçaba, the National Park of Lagoa do Peixe, and other areas. When eviction of traditional people occurs, environmentally protected areas are more easily invaded by commercial fishing and logging, and the overall situation becomes even worse.

base/coastal_fisheries_of_brazil_5.txt 13
Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 5
=> Information on the status of stocks of importance for small-scale (or artisanal) fisheries in north Brazil is scarce. Most of the information available refers to stocks that are also important to industrial fisheries, such as shrimp, lobster, catfish, and the southern red snapper (Table 3). The pink shrimp is under intense fishing pressure, and is probably exploited at its maximum biologically sustainable level, whereas the stocks of the seabob shrimp could possibly sustain higher catches. Recent reported landings of lobsters are very close to the predicted maximum sustainable yield, which indicates that the stock is probably fully exploited. The stock of catfish shows signs of recovery after being overfished for many years. The stock of southern red snapper has also recovered from a state of overfishing, but is now considered under high risk of becoming overfished again. The status of the stock(s) of the mangrove crab is unknown. Landing statistics indicate a decrease of about 50% in production since the early 1980s, although it is difficult to ascertain if the decrease is due to overfishing, or to the deterioration of the data collection system for fisheries statistics. All of the above species are listed in Annex II of the IN No. 5/2004, and are either overexploited or threatened by overexploitation. The total reported landings of these species for 2002 represents approximately 13% of the small-scale fisheries production in northern Brazil. The exploitation status of the remaining stocks is unknown. Through the analysis of trends in fisheries landings by species, Vasconcellos et al. (2007) concluded that there is a total of 74 small-scale fisheries stocks in the northern region, and that 27% of these stocks are in a developing stage, 24% are in a mature stage, 41% are in senescent stage, 4% in recovery and 3% collapsed (Figure 4). Approximately 56% of the total stocks could possibly sustain higher catches if managed sustainably in the future, while the remaining 44% (composed of stocks in a senescent or collapsed stage) are probably overfished.

=> The basins of the South Atlantic margin started forming in the Early Cretaceous with the break-up of Gondwana, the southern part of the former supercontinent Pangea. This tectonic movement resulted in a sequence of rift basins bordering the present-day South Atlantic on the Brazilian and southwestern African sides. The Pelotas-Namibia spreading commenced in the Hauterivian, around 133 million years ago, and reached the Santos Basin to the north in the Barremian. Seafloor spreading continued northwards to the Campos Basin in the Early Albian, at approximately 112 Ma.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 1
=> The development of artisanal fisheries faces many challenges due to the lack of policies, strategies and concrete experiences that can support sustainable fisheries production, better organization and improvement of the livelihood of fishing communities. There has been a continuous worsening of the problems affecting the production of artisanal fisheries owing to the depletion of fisheries resources, environmental degradation of coastal areas, and ultimately to the ineffectiveness of governmental strategies in overcoming the obstacles that impede the sustained development of the artisanal fishing communities along the Brazilian coast. The overall lack of information about these fisheries is a subsidiary problem that gives low political visibility to the sector and thus helps perpetuate its status. This chapter aims to provide a broad perspective of the status of artisanal coastal fisheries in Brazil, and to put forward some alternative strategies for the development of the sector. In describing these types of fisheries, we opted to concentrate as much as possible on general regional characteristics, but also highlight special features of relevance to particular fisheries when necessary.

base/Trindade_hotspot.txt 2
Paragraph about Trindade hotspot
=> This ideas was based on the geochemical data, especially of the highly silica-undersaturated alkaline ultramafic rocks of the Trindade Island and Martim Vaz Island. The isotopic data is OIB-type, which is favourable to the hot-spot hypothesis. However, the volcanic chain direction is E-W and the absolute motion vector of the South America Plate is NW. Therefore, the volcanic chain cannot be a hot-spot chain. Recent research papers, such as Skoletnev, Peyve & Truko 2010 and Motoki, Motoki & Melo 2012, proposed that the hot mantle penetrated horizontally along the Vitória-Trindade fracture zone which is present in the lithospheric mantle. Because of the same reason, the Fernando de Noronha Volcanic chain also is not a hot-spot chain. On the other hand, the NW-SE magmatic alignments, such as the Cruzeiro do Sul Chain, Bahia Chain, and Macau-Queimado, are considered to be hot-spot chains.

base/Alcatrazes_Islands.txt 8
Paragraph about Alcatrazes Islands
=> The islands are believed to present their very current format since at least 2.5 million years ago. However, during the last glacial period (in between 85 thousand and 15 thousand years ago), the sea water was receded in such a way that the archipelago was actually a mountain still connected to the continent.Alcatrazes is formed by five main islands. The biggest one is known as Alcatrazes Island (2.5 km long with an area of 170 hectares (420 acres)) and the other ones are called da Sapata, do Paredão, do Porto (or do Farol) and do Sul. There are also four unnamed islets; five lajes (Dupla, Singela, do Paredão, do Farol and Negra); and two placers (Nordeste and Sudeste). Its depth can reach 50 m. Its total oceanic coverage is of 67,000 hectares (170,000 acres).The highest point of the archipelago is the Boa Vista (or dos Alcatrazes) Peak, 316 m high. Another peak is do Oratório at 154 m. The islands' faces are marked by rocky, steep walls that can reach up to 200 metres (660 ft) in height. Between the southern and eastern arms of the main island is the Saco do Funil, the most protected part of the island and the place where the Brazilian Navy used to practice shooting (see details in the "History" section below).The Farol Island, also known as Porto Island, has a 7m tall lighthouse (hence its name; "farol" is Portuguese for lighthouse).

Paragraph about Trindade and Martin Vaz
=> Many visitors have been to Martin Vaz, the most famous of whom was the English astronomer Edmund Halley, who took possession of the island on behalf of the British Monarchy in 1700. Wild goats and hogs, descendants of ones set free by Halley, were still found on Martin Vaz in 1939.HMS Rattlesnake, a 198-ton, 12-gun cutter-rigged sloop, was wrecked on Trindade on 21 October 1781, shortly after Commander Philippe d'Auvergne had taken over command. Rattlesnake had been ordered to survey the island to ascertain whether it would make a useful base for outward-bound Indiamen. She anchored, but that evening the wind increased and by seven o’clock she was dragging. Two hours later the first cable parted and Commander d’Auvergne club-hauled his way out, setting main and fore sails, and using the remaining anchor cable as a spring. This successfully put Rattlesnake’s head to seaward. The remaining cable was then cut, and the sloop wore round and stood out to sea. However the ground now shallowed quite rapidly and suddenly Rattlesnake struck a submerged rock. She started filling with water, so, in order to preserve the lives of the crew, d'Auvergne ran her ashore. Commodore Johnstone on board HMS Jupiter had previously wished to colonise the island and claim it for Britain, so d'Auvergne agreed to stay on the tiny island with 30 sailors, 20 captured French sailors, one French woman, some animals and supplies. They were resupplied by another ship in January 1782, then they appear to have been forgotten, as they lived on the tiny island for a year until HMS Bristol and a convoy of Indiamen, which fortuitously called there, rescued them in late December 1782.Captain La Pérouse stopped there at the outset of his 1785 voyage to the Pacific.

They stayed briefly on Lajes Island, then moved to Serigipe Island, near the shore, where they built Fort Coligny. After they were expelled by Portuguese military expeditions in 1563, the colonial government built fortifications in several points of Guanabara Bay, rendering it almost impregnable against a naval attack from the sea. They were the Santa Cruz, São João, Lajes and Villegaignon forts, forming a fearsome crossfire rectangle of big naval guns. Other islands were adapted by the Navy to host naval storehouses, hospitals, drydocks, oil reservoirs and the National Naval Academy.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 7
=> Social movements and institutional arrangements for coastal managementSince the middle of the 1970s, public concern for coastal conservation has gathered momentum in Brazil. Some of the factors that explain this rising concern are:(a) The growing awareness of Brazilian society about the ecological importance of the coastal area and the increasing degradation of coastal ecosystems. The earlier positions of the Brazilian Government, which led to the country’s moniker: ‘Brazil welcomes polluting industries’, has changed since the Stockholm Conference in 1972. This is due to pressure from non-governmental organizations, international institutions and mainly because of the growing awareness of the population concerning environmental issues. In the 1970s, despite the presence of an authoritarian military regime favouring industrialization at any social or ecological cost, many environmental groups were created. In the final years of the military regime (until 1984), national campaigns were organized by environmental movements on issues such as the destruction of the Amazon and Atlantic Forests, the Pantanal wetlands, pollution in urban centres (such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro), and the establishment of nuclear plants along the coast. Hundreds of small groups blossomed to oppose whale hunting, tree cutting in urban areas and destruction of national parks. Although many of these groups were formed by the middle class and were urban biased, they were instrumental in raising the level of environmental awareness in the country. They succeeded in electing a few representatives in the state legislatures of the more urbanized states such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. In 1986, some candidates with strong environmental concern were elected to the National Congress, which developed the 1988 Constitution. For the first time specific considerations of the conservation of coastal ecosystems were included in the Constitution.

=> Artisanal fisheries in the northeast are based on small- to medium-sized boats (most of them <12 m long) using sail or small engines, canoes using oars or sail, and sail rafts. There is a large diversity of species and fishing gear/methods used in coastal fisheries in the northeast. Lessa et al. (2004) identified, for instance, at least 16 types of gear used by small-scale fishers in Pernambuco, one of the states of the northeast region. In general, gillnets, longlines and hook-and-line are used in coastal and offshore waters to catch snappers, groupers, mackerel, sardines, pompanos, tunas and dolphinfish. Lobsters are captured mostly with gillnets (caçoeiras) and by diving. Shrimp trawling is conducted in certain areas close to the mouth of estuaries. Gillnets, trammel nets, cast nets, manual trawling and traps are employed closer to shore and inside estuaries and coastal lagoons to capture anchovies, mullets, needle-fish, and shrimps, among other species. The manual collection of crabs and molluscs in mangrove areas is particularly important throughout the region.

In a basin modeling study performed in 2008 and 2009, a detailed facies model from the pre-salt section was built based on well data and conceptual models from seismic interpretation associated with previous knowledge of the tectono-sedimentary sequences of the Santos Basin. The predicted vitrinite map, integrated with all data, indicates that the Coquinas source rock in most of the eastern half area is in the main oil window, whereas the western half is in the late oil/wet gas generation window. In terms of transformation ratio, the Barremian and Aptian source rock systems in the area reached 70% to 80% today where the main depocentres are. The charge and accumulation simulation model for the pre-salt province suggests a potential reserve in the Cluster area of Santos Basin much larger than that reported, getting numbers to 60 billion barrels of oil reserves.

Paragraph about Santos Basin
=> Exploration in the Santos Basin started in the 1970s. Between 1970 and 1987, 59 dry wells were drilled, with one discovery in Santonian turbidites in 1979, Merluza Field. From 1988 to 1998, 45 wells were drilled in the basin providing small discoveries, with the 30 million barrels (4.8 million cubic metres) of oil equivalent Tubarão Field discovered in 1988. Eighty-one wells were drilled from 1999 to 2005, leading to the discovery of the Mexilhão Field. Exploration boomed between 2006 and 2012, with 166 wells and the giant Tupi field (8 BBOE), discovered at the Tupi prospect in 2006. In 2013, the Sagitário Field was discovered in the sub-salt carbonates at a water depth of 1,871 metres (6,138 ft) and a true vertical depth of 6,150 metres (20,180 ft).In 2014, the pre-salt reservoirs of the Santos Basin produced more than 250 thousand barrels per day (40×10^3 m3/d). Thanks to the pre-salt production, compensating for the declining post-salt production, the total oil production of Brazil rose above 2,500 thousand barrels per day (400×10^3 m3/d) in April 2016. The Lapa Field, originally named Carioca, was taken in production in December 2016. In 2017, the Santos Basin accounted for 35% of Brazil's oil, with the Campos Basin at 55%. In the same year, 76 blocks were open for bidding in the Santos Basin.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 8
=> Historically, artisanal fishers in Brazil have been labelled as inefficient and unproductive and, consequently, considered as objects of social welfare programmes. The available information about the sector demystifies this approach by showing, for instance, that the artisanal fishery is as productive as the industrial fishery in terms of total landings’ volume. Therefore, the artisanal fishery deserves at least the same level of attention for development policies as received by the industrial fishery sector. In fact, it has been argued that the artisanal fishery is more economically viable and more socially desirable, especially for the exploitation of coastal ecosystems. This is justified by a number of factors, such as the nature of the fishery resources available in coastal tropical areas (multispecies and small-stock sizes), the spatial dispersion of fishing communities, the ample utilization of materials locally available, the direct supply of fish to local/regional markets, and the reduced use of fossil fuels.

Paragraph about Trindade hotspot
=> This ideas was based on the geochemical data, especially of the highly silica-undersaturated alkaline ultramafic rocks of the Trindade Island and Martim Vaz Island. The isotopic data is OIB-type, which is favourable to the hot-spot hypothesis. However, the volcanic chain direction is E-W and the absolute motion vector of the South America Plate is NW. Therefore, the volcanic chain cannot be a hot-spot chain. Recent research papers, such as Skoletnev, Peyve & Truko 2010 and Motoki, Motoki & Melo 2012, proposed that the hot mantle penetrated horizontally along the Vitória-Trindade fracture zone which is present in the lithospheric mantle. Because of the same reason, the Fernando de Noronha Volcanic chain also is not a hot-spot chain.

Paragraph about Port of Santos
=> The port of Santos was originally founded in 1892 on the banks of the Santos River. In 1913, there were about 90,00 inhabitants in the city of Santos and the economically active population was at about 37,000 with 22.7 percent working in the port as longshoremen, stevedores, carters, porters and coffee sackers. During the time after World War II, up to 1960, the port was known as the “Red Port” because of strong influence of Communism in the workers unions and city’s politics. Lack of investments and high tariffs were factors observed at the time and led the Port of Santos to a rapid decay around 1970. In 1980, the 90-year concession period ceded to Companhia Docas de Santos or CODESP. CODESP was a big player in the ports structure and worker culture. CODESP was in control of most of the port operations, created a new culture of work that created stronger bonds between the workers, and allowed for the creation of institutions to unite different categories of workers. Ever since the late 19th century the CODESP has tried to gain even more control over port operations. This, however, violated the workers’ sense of freedom and independence and caused the uprising of many of the worker institutions through different strikes for worker rights. In 1993, the Brazilian government realized that the singular control over the port that CODESP had was inhibiting the ports ability to be competitive and be more efficient. They then passed a law that de-monopolized the port's operational services.

To control these rebellions, in 1921 the Brazilian Navy created the first fishers guilds (Colônias de Pescadores). According to the guild regulations, all fishers should be registered in order to receive permission to fish. In practice, each coastal municipality had its own guild that regulated the lives of fishers. However, with the promulgation of the new Brazilian Constitution in 1988, fishers were given rights to organize their own free associations.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 2
=> In the state of Rio de Janeiro, on the southeast coast, the most important artisanal fisheries utilize gear such as hook-and-line, gillnet, beach seine, shrimp trawls and manual collection of shell/crab. One of the most traditional activities is the beach seine fishery based on large canoes and seine nets to encircle migrating schools of bluefish, mullets and bonitos (Silva, 2002). Shrimp are caught in the coastal lagoons using fixed nets, manual trawling and cast nets. Small purse seiners also participate in the sardine fishery in coastal waters. In the state of São Paulo, one of the most important and traditional fisheries is the engraulid Anchoviella lepidendostole fishery. This fishery occurs mainly in estuaries and is carried out with wooden canoes, 4 to 5 m long, using oars or small engines, and employs trawling nets and other types of gear (Gasalla and Tomas, 1998). In the state of Paraná, fishing activities are predominantly small-scale (Andriguetto-Filho et al., 2006). Important fishing activities in the region are the trawl fishery for marine shrimp along the coast and in estuaries, the gillnet fishery for sharks and demersal fishes (mostly Sciaenidae), and the estuarine fisheries for juvenile shrimp, engraulids and mullets. The manual collection of crabs and molluscs is also significant. Further south, in the state of Santa Catarina, beach seining for coastal fishes, estuarine fisheries for shrimps with fixed nets and trawling, gillnet fisheries for croaker, weakfish and flatfish, and jigging (zangarilho) for squid are important artisanal fishing activities (Sunye and Morison, 2006).

One clear example is the BR-101 built in the 1970s, which links many coastal capitals. During the construction process, many beaches and mangrove areas were damaged as the road was built along the coast between Santos and Rio de Janeiro. These coastal roads have also encouraged the construction of villas by tourists, and have displaced many small-scale fishing villages to inland and to the mangrove areas, resulting in the destruction of the Atlantic Forest.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 7
=> In addition to these impacts on artisanal fisheries, there has been a dramatic increase in the demand for fish in the growing urban centres. Some valuable fish species, such as shrimp and lobsters, are more intensively exploited. When profitability decreased, most industrial fishing crews started exploiting fish resources with no respect for existing traditional regulations. In some cases, artisanal fishers started using the same forbidden fishing gear in order to survive.Third, traditional sea tenure is threatened as well by erroneous environmental and aquaculture plans that should benefit artisanal fishers in principle. Government institutions are encouraging aquaculture; however, traditional extensive aquaculture systems already used by artisanal fishers are very often not considered. As a result, in some cases capital owners and outsiders are the only ones who benefit from these initiatives. The government also promoted the cultivation of species already managed by artisanal fishers. The adoption of these techniques does not necessarily lead to an improvement in the well-being of local communities. For instance, the government planned to introduce mullet cultivation through floating nets (cercos flutuantes) instead of supporting the existing technique of the traditional cerco made of bamboo poles. In fact, floating nets are more capital intensive, less labour intensive and would disrupt the existing social organization. In the end, the new technique was eventually rejected by artisanal fishers.

base/coastal_fisheries_of_brazil_5.txt 13
Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 5
=> Table 5 summarizes the available information about the status of small-scale fisheries resources exploited in southeast Brazil. As defined in Vasconcellos et al. (2007), the southeast encompasses the southeast and part of east biophysical regions defined in Figure 2. Sardine does not show signs of recovery since the collapse of the stock in the early 1990s. The stock of the broadband anchovy (Anchoviella lepindentostole) is under intense fishing pressure and the current level of exploitation is considered unsustainable. The stock of seabob shrimp presents clear signs of overexploitation with a continuous decrease in landings since the late 1980s. The three main demersal fish stocks, the white croaker, royal weakfish and weakfish, are either fully exploited or overexploited. The status of the grey triggerfish is unknown, but the recent increasing trend in landings and catch per unit effort (CPUE) indicates that the stock is probably not yet overfished. The anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) is a potential resource in the region, which is not commercially exploited yet. With the exception of the anchovies and the weakfish, all other species are listed in Annex II of IN No. 5/2004, and are considered overexploited or threatened by overexploitation. The species listed above account for 53% of the reported small-scale fisheries landings in 2002, with the grey triggerfish composing 36.1% of this total. The status of the remaining stocks responsible for 47% of small-scale fisheries production is unknown. The analysis of the development stage of 191 small-scale fisheries stocks in the southeast indicated that: 12% are in a development stage, 21% mature, 30% in a senescent stage, 7% recovering and 29% collapsed (Vasconcellos et al., 2007; Figure 4). Thus, approximately 60% of the stocks are probably overfished and unable to support higher yields in the future unless measures to reduce fishing pressure are applied.

However, during the last glacial period (in between 85 thousand and 15 thousand years ago), the sea water was receded in such a way that the archipelago was actually a mountain still connected to the continent.Alcatrazes is formed by five main islands. The biggest one is known as Alcatrazes Island (2.5 km long with an area of 170 hectares (420 acres)) and the other ones are called da Sapata, do Paredão, do Porto (or do Farol) and do Sul. There are also four unnamed islets; five lajes (Dupla, Singela, do Paredão, do Farol and Negra); and two placers (Nordeste and Sudeste). Its depth can reach 50 m. Its total oceanic coverage is of 67,000 hectares (170,000 acres).The highest point of the archipelago is the Boa Vista (or dos Alcatrazes) Peak, 316 m high. Another peak is do Oratório at 154 m. The islands' faces are marked by rocky, steep walls that can reach up to 200 metres (660 ft) in height. Between the southern and eastern arms of the main island is the Saco do Funil, the most protected part of the island and the place where the Brazilian Navy used to practice shooting (see details in the "History" section below).The Farol Island, also known as Porto Island, has a 7m tall lighthouse (hence its name; "farol" is Portuguese for lighthouse).

=> In 1989, with the declaration of the Constitution, the movement phased out, but MONAPE became operational. The main challenge for MONAPE is the stimulation of an independent and democratic organization of artisanal fishers, seeking to maintain the rights earned by the 1988 Constitution and to fight for new social and labour rights. The MONAPE has organized various national meetings of its members, also inviting representatives from organizations of fish workers from neighbouring countries like the Confederación Nacional de Pescadores Artesanales de Chile (CONAPACH). MONAPE is active only in the northern regions where it is based, as well as in some states of the northeast. Unfortunately, MONAPE has not succeeded in establishing itself as a national movement capable of offering alternatives to the existing institutional framework that is marked by protectionism and the lack of clear and effective policies favouring artisanal fishing, as mentioned before.

base/Rio_Grande_Rise.txt 4
Paragraph about Rio Grande Rise
=> A Brazilian-Japanese expedition in 2013 recovered in situ granitic and metamorphic rocks on the Rio Grande Rise. This can possibly indicate that the plateau includes fragments of continental crust — possible remains of micro-continents similar to those found on and around Kerguelen in the Indian Ocean and Jan Mayen in the Arctic Ocean. The existence of such microcontinents is speculative, however, since their remains tend to be covered by younger layers of lava and sediments. Nevertheless, transoceanic dispersals are hinted at by the fossil record of, for example, flightless birds such as Lavocatavis, indicating that several islands between Africa and South America made island hopping possible across the Atlantic during the Tertiary (66 to 2.58 Ma).At the beginning of the Maastrichtian, the characteristics of water masses differed north and south of the Rio Grande Rice-Walvis Ridge complex. The disappearance of these differences during the Maastritchtian indicates a reorganisation of oceanic circulation patterns that lead to a global homogenisation of intermediate and deep waters. This process seems to have been triggered by the breaching of the Rio Grande Rise-Walvis Ridge complex and the disappearance of epicontinental seaways such as the Tethys Ocean. The process resulted in the deterioration of rudist-dominated tropical habitats and consequently the extinction of benthic inoceramid bivalves.The origin of modern circulation of cold, deep water — known as the "Big Flush" — is associated with Early Eocene (55 to 40 Ma) geological events; tectonism that resulted in the opening of the north-east Atlantic and fracture zones that developed in the subsiding Rio Grande Rise, which allowed cold water from the Antarctic Weddell Sea to flow northward into the North Atlantic. 40 Ma, the generation of cold bottom water in the Antarctic resulted in the formation of psychrospheric fauna, which today live in temperatures below 10 °C (50 °F), in the Atlantic and Tethys. This global distribution suggests that the Rio Grande Rise had been breached by this time, allowing cold, dense water to move north-south through a corridor enhancing the transition from a latitudinal thermospheric circulation to a meridional thermohaline circulation.

These clastic units are thought to represent alluvial environments distributed along the western Brazilian basin margin, along the Santos Hinge Line. These alluvial environments were gradational towards the east, with the shallow marine carbonates of the Guarujá Formation, and further to the open basin with the siltstones of the Itanhaém Formation. Biostratigraphical data and its relations with the Guarujá Formation point towards an Albian age.

base/Pre_salt_layer.txt 9
Paragraph about Pre salt layer
=> The pre-salt layer is a diachronous series of geological formations on the continental shelves of extensional basins formed after the break-up of Gondwana, characterised by the deposition of thick layers of evaporites, mostly salt. Some of the petroleum that was generated from sediments in the pre-salt layer, has not migrated upward (see salt dome) to the post-salt layers above. This is especially common off the coast of Africa and Brazil. The total oil reserves are thought to be a significant fraction of the world's reserves. According to Petrobras, the oil and natural gas lie below an approximately 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) thick layer of salt, itself below in places more than 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) of post-salt sediments, in water depths between 2,000 and 3,000 metres (6,600 and 9,800 ft) in the South Atlantic. Drilling through the rock and salt to extract the pre-salt oil and gas is very expensive.

=> The majority of women work as shellfish harvesters, selling the yield to increase the domestic income. In some states of the northeast region, such as Bahia, approximately 20 000 marisqueiras participate actively in earning domestic income. In states such as Maranhão, northern Brazil, women participate in fishing ‘on foot’ with small shrimp nets. The shrimp is brined, dried and sold by the women. This activity is also common in other states of Brazil. The activity of women is also important in some fishing communities where they weave and darn the fishing nets. In many other communities, women work in small-scale agriculture, producing yucca flour, which is the basic diet of coastal populations in many areas. Urban industrial employment is another field where women are active participants, working in the fish processing industry. In many cases the workforce is almost entirely female.

base/Port_of_Santos.txt 11
Paragraph about Port of Santos
=> The port is the principal source of jobs for the city of Santos. The fact that the town is mainly dependent on the one industry of the port, a strike in the port would cause considerable losses that could affect the entire city of Santos. Whenever the workers stopped working, the movement of goods would stop flowing, halting businesses, the flow of money, and all internal trade. This meant that when a strike would happen, the whole city joined the side of the workers because the city’s population knew that the only way to return to the way of life was to end the strike.  In 2016 the port declared that it had insufficient funds to pay for extra benefits and raises causing slowdowns. The workers were constantly unsatisfied and therefore demanded a 10% raise and were complaining about their new shift patterns. The strike halted all activities in the port terminals except for the release of dangerous cargoes, drugs, perishables, live cargo, funeral urns, and shipboard supplies.The Santos port and the port workers were not separated from the rest of the city. The financial and commercial center of the city was close to the docks, which made for a more heterogeneous society in those areas. The life of port workers was far from insular and was shaped by a strong urban culture, as working class politics invaded spaces previously closed to workers' political expression. In Santos, the neighborhoods of the workers weren’t separated by different occupation, as others were at the time. They also all had offices together which expedited the process of creating unified movements.

=> There is a continuing debate on the definition of the term ‘artisanal fisheries’. The Superintendence for the Development of Fisheries (SUDEPE, which was the governmental agency for fisheries development from 1967 to 1988) defined the artisanal fishery as the fishery carried out by boats with less than 20 tonnes of capacity. This definition is clearly unsatisfactory considering that some industrial fishing boats also fall into this category. As a result, statistics on the production of artisanal fisheries are not accurate.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 2
=> Finally, in southern Brazil, artisanal fisheries operate mostly in coastal lagoons, estuaries and shallow coastal waters using wooden boats, most of them less than 10 m long and under 20 gross tonnes. The main artisanal fishing activities are the gillnet fisheries for croaker, mullets and flatfish, and the fishery for shrimps with fixed nets and trawling (D’Incao, 1991; Reis et al., 1994; Kalikoski et al., 2002). A medium-scale commercial fishery operates in coastal waters (Reis et al., 1994). The fleet is composed of wooden boats, 12 to 15 m long, with more powerful engines, and targets demersal fishes (mostly Sciaenidae) and also pelagic species such as the bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) using gillnets and hook-and-line.

=> The MER initiative is exceptionally promising; it has the potential to unify and reconcile elements that all too often are seen as incompatible: traditional culture heritage and cultural resource preservation needs, sustainable local fisheries, and conservation of marine biological diversity. Various provisions of national environmental legislation (namely Law No. 9.985 instituting SNUC; Decree IBAMA No. 22 / 2-10-92), civil codes, and international treaties to which Brazil is a signatory (e.g. Articles 8j, 10c, 10d of the Convention on Biological Diversity) endorse the principles on which collectively held marine extractive reserves are based. However, it remains to be seen whether protected areas can be implemented and effectively managed on a scale broad enough to have biologically significant impacts, as well as questions concerning their social feasibility and economic viability.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 6
=> (c) Sustainable Development Reserves (SDR): defined as “areas used by traditional populations, whose existence is based on systems of sustainable exploitation of natural resources, developed through generations and adapted to the local ecological conditions, and that have played a key role in nature conservation and in the maintenance of biological diversity”. The objectives of the SDRs are “to preserve nature and at the same time to ensure the necessary conditions and means to sustain and improve the living conditions and the use of natural resources by traditional populations, as well as to appreciate and conserve the traditional knowledge-practice systems of environmental management of these populations”. SDRs are also managed by a deliberative council of organizations and communities representatives which is responsible for developing and implementing a management plan that defines, inter alia, no-take protected areas, buffer zones and corridors, and areas for sustainable use. The first and most well-known example is the Mamiraua SDR in the Amazon region.

base/Alcatrazes_Islands.txt 8
Paragraph about Alcatrazes Islands
=> Alcatrazes possesses rich fauna and flora; by December 2019, 1,3 thousand species had been registered there, 93 of which were deemed endangered and 20 were endemic, including the Bothrops alcatraz, the Scinax alcatraz and the true frog Cycloramphus faustoi. Other endemic species yet to be discovered are believed to exist there, including a species of coral snake which two only known individuals were lost during the fire at the Instituto Butantan.Such occurrence of endemism lead the archipelago to be nicknamed "the Galápagos of Brazil" by some researchers, who believe Charles Darwin would have come to the same conclusions he came to in the Equatorian archipelago had he studied the fauna of Alcatrazes. As described in the sub-section "Geology" above, the islands were for tens of thousands of years linked to the continent, which provided easy access to the place for several species. As the waters rose again and the mountains returned to their island status, the animals that were stranded there either died or adapted and evolved, giving birth to all those unique species.On the main island there is the world's biggest cluster of frigatebirds' nests, with a gathering of 6,000 individuals. Some 10,000 birds live in the archipelago, with over 100 different confirmed species, including endangered ones like the American oystercatcher and the South American tern.In the waters surrounding the archipelago, several species live among the grooved brain corals, including 400 species of invertebrates and between 200 and 250 species of fish, a number superior to anywhere else in Brazil, including the much bigger Fernando de Noronha archipelago, with 150 species. The place is also visited by cetaceans. The not so long but also not so short distance between island and continent combined with the fact that it is located in a transition zone of warm tropical waters to colder subtropical ones make for the big diversity of fishes.The sea around the islands wouldn't receive much attention until the 1990s, because diving was not yet regarded as a true scientific tool in Brazil. It was in the archipelago that such reality began to change.Beside the Navy exercises, another threat to the local ecosystem is the sea pollution, be it from chemical dejects (which contaminate the plankton and, consequently, the whole food chain involved with it) or incorrectly disposed waste. The invasive orange cup coral is another risk to the local fauna. They were first detected in 2011 and, since then, they are monitored and removed so they do not become a plague, although its eradication is no longer considered possible to achieve.

These clastic units are thought to represent alluvial environments distributed along the western Brazilian basin margin, along the Santos Hinge Line. These alluvial environments were gradational towards the east, with the shallow marine carbonates of the Guarujá Formation, and further to the open basin with the siltstones of the Itanhaém Formation. Biostratigraphical data and its relations with the Guarujá Formation point towards an Albian age.

Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 1
=> Artisanal fishers are organized into a number of fishing communities settled along the coast and in small coastal towns in Brazil. Artisanal fishing is conducted in a variety of coastal ecosystems. The characteristics of habitats, fauna, productivity and oceanography of these ecosystems greatly influence the way fishing activities are developed. On a broad scale, the Brazilian coastline can be divided into five large ecosystems with distinct environmental characteristics of importance to capture fisheries (Matssura, 1995; Figure 1).

base/Ilha_dos_Frades.txt 12
Paragraph about Ilha dos Frades
=> By the early 18th century, the island belonged to João Nogueira. Nogueira lived on the island with six or seven tenant farmers. The island had streams too small to support sugar cane cultivation; the tenant farmers only raised cows and pigs and grew subsistence crops. Francisco da Costa is recorded as an early owner of the island; he constructed the first Chapel of Loreto, or Church of Our Lady of Loreto (Igreja de Nossa Senhora de Loreto) in 1645. It was reconstructed in a new location in 1756. The Ilha dos Frades played an important part in the illegal slave trade in Bahia in the 19th century. Illegal landings were made at the Ilha da Itaparica and Ilha da Mare and enslaved people were led directly to the interior of Bahia, a practice that only ended with the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.Franklin Américo de Meneses Dória, the Baron of Loreto, was born on the Ilha dos Frades in 1836. Loreto was a lawyer, politician, poet, and founding member of the Academia Brasileira de Letras. Gabriel Viana, a plantation owner, ruled the island in the manner of a feudal lord during the República Velha, or First Brazilian Republic (1889-1930). Viana alternately decided on the punishment and execution of residents of the island and served as a benefactor of the local community.

base/Port_of_Santos.txt 11
Paragraph about Port of Santos
=> Two issues facing the port today are access and distribution within the port. Due to the fact that the port operates 24 hours a day there is a lot of congestion on the roads and railways. There is only a three-lane road with two of those lanes for entry to the port and one for exiting. The port is considering a few possible solutions such as deepening the channels, applying intelligent transportation systems technologies, and better truck storage facilities. These plans for expansion have been planned to be put in place by the year 2024 due to the economic growth of the town. According to CODESP, all of these projects the Port of Santos will be moving three times more cargo, from the current 97.2 million tons to 230 million tons, with the general cargo accounting for 53% of this volume, solid bulk for 30% and liquid bulk for 17%. The ports difficulties of flow in the port areas can be categorized into four different areas: the difficulties of flow in the port areas, the constraints to the rail model, the poor utilization of the capacity of the maritime terminals and the congestion in accesses.

It was considered that the supposed hot-spot should be responsible for the creation of the east-west trending Vitória-Trindade seamount chain, which includes the Trindade and Martim Vaz archipelago at its easternmost end. Trindade, a small island in the archipelago, is the hotspot's most recent eruptive center.

base/coastal_fisheries_of_brazil_5.txt 13
Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 5
=> The management of fisheries in Brazil is mainly the responsibility of the federal government, which is responsible for assessing the status of the stocks and for setting and enforcing regulations on the use of aquatic living resources. Governmental institutional arrangements for regulating fisheries activities have been changing over the years. The role of the federal government in marine fisheries management became particularly influential in the mid-1960s with the creation of SUDEPE, an agency of the Ministry of Agriculture with sole responsibility for the development and management of fisheries. Later in 1989, fisheries became one of the agendas of IBAMA (Brazilian Institute of the Environment), a subsidiary of the Ministry of Environment. The shift of management responsibilities from SUDEPE to IBAMA was not favourable to artisanal fisheries. As IBAMA focuses its attention mostly on environmental issues, environmental legislation and law enforcement, there has been little attention given to the sustained development of artisanal fishing communities. In 1998, the government shifted a large part of the responsibilities of the fisheries sector from IBAMA to the Ministry of Agriculture, constituting the Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (DPA). The main responsibility of DPA was to promote and execute programmes and projects to support the development of the industrial fisheries (its main objective was to promote the development of the sector and to manage unexploited fisheries resources). On the other hand, IBAMA was responsible for executing the national policies for the environment, and particularly for managing endangered and overexploited species, and encouraging the sharing and decentralization of decisions through co-management and community-based management initiatives. The development policies put forth by these two agencies were not only diverse but opposite and conflictive in their approach to resource management. According to Dias-Neto (1999) such a change represented “one of the most anarchical moments in fisheries management in Brazilian history”. Dias-Neto and Marrul-Filho (2003) highlighted the three main institutional conflicts created with the division of responsibilities between IBAMA and DPA. The first one was of a legal nature, related to the division of competencies in fisheries management, and in the organization and maintenance of the national system of control and licensing of fishing activities. The second one was conceptual, since stocks are intrinsically linked in the marine environment through ecological and/or technological interactions, and in multispecific fisheries the same fishing activity often targets stocks with different exploitation levels. Besides, a stock that is considered unexploited at a given moment could eventually be overfished and, hence, the same species could be under the responsibility of two different agencies at different moments in time. As stated by the authors “IBAMA and DPA were trying to divide the indivisible”. The third conflict was related to the transfer of responsibility from IBAMA to DPA for the management and control of foreign fleets fishing under joint-venture arrangement, and the consequent changes in the rules and norms.

According to data from the 2000 census, there are about 248 000 fishers on the coast organized into fishers’ guilds. The northeast has approximately 62% of the total number of guilds, followed by the southeast with 16%, south with 12% and the north with 10% (data provided by the Confederation of Fishers, 1986). Also, according to the Confederation there are approximately 288 500 fishers who are not affiliated with the guilds. Thus, there are approximately 536 000 artisanal coastal fishers in Brazil.

base/coastal_fisheries_of_brazil_8.txt 15
Paragraph about coastal fisheries of brazil 8
=> Information on artisanal fisheries is generally scarce, and the fisheries production statistics present many limitations. The institution with legal responsibility to collect and disseminate fisheries statistics is IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), but in 1990 IBGE’s system of collection was interrupted. Since 1995, IBAMA started compiling and disseminating the data collected by different institutions in different states. Some projects include: ESTATPESCA developed by IBAMA’s Center of Fisheries Research and Management for the Northeast Coast (CEPENE) for the northeastern states and by IBAMA’s Center of Fisheries Research and Management for the North Coast (CEPENOR) for Pará; the system of control of landings developed by São Paulo’s Instituto de Pesca, Univali, IBAMA’s Center of Fisheries Research and Management for the South Coast (CEPSUL); and IBAMA’s Center of Fisheries Research and Management of Estuarine and Lagoon Fisheries (CEPERG) in southeastern and southern Brazil. However, the lack of a standardization of methodologies used in the collection of statistics is a factor that precludes the comparative assessment of fisheries production among states. One particular problem with the landings statistics in some states is the lack of a more precise classification of fisheries production by artisanal fishery types, with a tendency to aggregate all artisanal fisheries production in a single category of boats with less than 20 tonnes of gross tonnage. One exception is the system of data collection of the project ESTATPESCA, which provides more detailed information about artisanal fishery production in the northeastern states. Another important limitation of landings statistics is the large volume of catches that are not precisely identified. Landed fish is often classified according to the commercial or common names, which do not allow the precise identification of the species. This problem occurs due to a combination of factors: the difficulty in monitoring of fishing in areas of high biodiversity and the preferential allocation of human and financial resources to the monitoring of large stocks targeted by industrial fisheries, among other causes. Illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing is also recognized as a problem that erodes the quality of fisheries catch statistics and leads to an underestimation of fisheries production (Isaac et al., 2006b; Peres et al., in press; Vasconcellos et al., in press).

The "Fernando de Noronha-Mecejana" volcano lineament has been attributed to such a transform fault. It is also possible that such a fracture zone and a hotspot simultaneously contributed to the development of the volcanics.
